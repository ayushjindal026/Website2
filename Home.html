    <h2><span>Health and Fitness </span></h2>
    <p>
      Many people strive to be fit. Fitness, after all, is synonymous with
      health. Having a high level of overall fitness is linked with a lower risk
      of chronic disease, as well as a better ability to manage health issues
      that do come up. Better fitness also promotes more functionality and
      mobility throughout one’s life span.
      <br />
      Simply put: Our bodies are meant to move, and they tend to function better
      when we’re more fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, it’s also important to know that there are many different ways
      to be fit (think of a ballet dancer versus a bodybuilder or a sprinter
      versus a gymnast). And fitness does not have a singular “look.” In fact,
      appearance can’t necessarily tell you about someone’s habits, whether
      they’re actually physically active, or even whether they’re fit at all.And
      in the short term, being active can help your day-to-day functioning, from
      better mood to sharper focus to better sleep.
    </p>
    <h3>What It Means to Be Fit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cardiorespiratory Fitness</li>
      <li>Musculoskeletal Fitness</li>
      <li>Musculoskeletal Fitness</li>
      <li>Balance</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of Fitness</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few main components of fitness, all of which are important for
      building a well-rounded exercise routine. Below, you will find the ones
      included in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which HHS
      highlights as the components that should be included in weekly exercise.
      (It’s worth noting that many definitions of fitness include other
      components as well, such as endurance, muscular endurance, power, speed,
      balance, and agility — as mentioned above.)
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Aerobic (Cardiovascular) Exercise</li>
      <li>Strength Training</li>
      <li>Flexibility and Mobility</li>
      <li>Rest and Recovery</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Much Exercise Do You Need?</h3>
    <p>
      Per the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services, clocking either 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) or 75 minutes
      of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (such as jogging or running) per
      week is the lowest amount of exercise that promotes good health. (Doing a
      combination of moderate and vigorous activity is also okay, as long as you
      spread it out over at least two days during the week.) Additionally, do
      muscle-strengthening activity at least two days a week, targeting all of
      the major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and
      arms), according to the guidelines.
      <br />
      There is currently no recommendation for flexibility or mobility work,
      according to the HHS. But older adults in particular should incorporate
      balance training into their weekly physical activity.
      <br />
      Doing more physical activity has been linked to even greater health
      benefits, particularly up to 300 weekly minutes of moderate-intensity
      exercise (after which the incremental benefits start to flatten out). And
      know that these baseline fitness recommendations, while they are enough to
      promote good long-term health, may not be sufficient to meet certain
      health or fitness goals. (For example, you will need to exercise for a
      significantly longer amount of time each week if you want to train for a
      marathon.)
      <br />
      And know that extreme amounts of exercise may put increased stress on the
      body and can actually lead to some negative health effects; research has
      yet to determine what that upper limit might be, but the evidence so far
      suggests that it is at least several times the current weekly minimum
      recommendations.
